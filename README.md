 FINAL-TASK-PROJECT:
This project is about checking if a news article is real or fake using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). First, the news text is cleaned by removing extra words and symbols. Then, the text is changed into numbers using a method called TF-IDF so that a computer can understand it. A machine learning model is trained to learn from real and fake news examples. After training, the model can check any new article and predict if it is real or fake.
